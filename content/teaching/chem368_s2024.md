### Midterm
The midterm is schedules for Thursday, April 18 from <time>11:00 am</time> to <time>12:20 pm</time> (during class time). Some information: 

- The syllabus will cover content up until the week before.
- You are allowed to bring a formula/cheat sheet (only 2 pages), a calculator, and **you will not be allowed to use the internet during the test.**
- There will be 5 questions.

### Final
Please choose between one of these two options for the final:

1. Write a simple Hartree-Fock or DFT code with a two-page explanation of what it does. The source and/or executable should be submitted and the instructors/TA should be able to run it.

1. Perform a short research project that would involve setting up a calculation (or a series of calculations) based on the methods described in the class on a system of your choice, running such calculation(s), and writing a max 3-page report, as it if were a scientific paper, in which the method used should be described, together with the findings.

The final should be delivered no later than <time>May 20, 2024</time>.
