I am Matthew. I do research on theoretical and computational chemistry. A long
time ago, I used to do experimental biochemistry/biomaterials work. I currently
contribute to [*PySCF*](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf),
[*OpenMolcas*](https://gitlab.com/Molcas/OpenMolcas), and
[*sci-rs*](https://github.com/qsib-cbie/sci-rs).

You can see all of my [code projects](/projects) and [research](/research), past
and present. My CV can be found [here](/cv.pdf).

<b style="color: var(--alert)">Update!</b> Check out my latest articles:
- *The modern era of multireference methods for chemistry and materials science* published in the [***chemRxiv***](https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-h9c6z)
- *Weighted Active Space Selection for Multireference Machine-Learned Potentials* published in [***PNAS***](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2513693122)
- *Analytic dipole moments for complete active space linearized pair-density functional theory* published on the [***chemRxiv***](https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dksr2-v2)
- *Multireference Embedding and Fragmentation Methods for Classical and Quantum Computers: From Model Systems to Realistic Applications* published on the [***arXiv***](https://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.13394)

If you need to get in touch, feel free to send me an
[email](/contact)! I will hopefully respond unless it has
gotten trapped in my spam filter (likely). I am unlikely to respond on other
socials.
