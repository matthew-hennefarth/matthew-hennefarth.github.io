I am Matthew. I do research on theoretical and computational chemistry. A long
time ago, I used to do experimental biochemistry/biomaterials work. I currently
contribute to [*PySCF*](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf),
[*PySCF-forge*](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf-forge), and
[*OpenMolcas*](https://gitlab.com/Molcas/OpenMolcas).

You can see all of my [code projects](/projects) and [research](/research), past
and present. My CV can be found [here](/cv.pdf).

<b style="color: var(--alert)">Update!</b> Check out my latest article on
*Semiclassical Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics Using Linearized Pair-Density
Functional Theory* on the [**arXiv**](10.48550/arXiv.2408.05434). 

If you need to get in touch, feel free to send me an
[email](/contact)! I will hopefully respond unless it has
gotten trapped in my spam filter (likely). I am unlikely to respond on other
socials.
